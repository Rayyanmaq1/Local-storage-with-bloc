## State Management

The app uses the BLoC pattern for state management. Each feature in the `features` directory has its own BLoC for managing the state and business logic. BLoC helps to separate the UI and business logic, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- `flutter_bloc`: For implementing the BLoC pattern and state management.
- `bloc`: The core library for BLoC pattern.
- `equatable`: For simplifying equality comparisons between objects.
- `get_it`: For service locator, providing dependency injection.
- `intl`: For internationalization and formatting dates and numbers.
- `floor`: For local database operations.
- `retrofit`: For making API calls to the News API.
- `flutter_hooks`: For implementing hooks in Flutter.
- `cached_network_image`: For loading and caching images from the web.
- `retrofit_generator`: For generating code for the Retrofit library.
- `floor_generator`: For generating code for the Floor database.
- `build_runner`: For running code generation tasks.
- `dio`: For making HTTP requests and handling network-related tasks.

These dependencies are defined in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
